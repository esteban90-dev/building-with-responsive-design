#Building With Responsive Design 

This is the [Building with Responsive Design project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design) from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/).

This project involved cloning [The Next Web's homepage](https://thenextweb.com/).  Responsive breakpoints were implemented to optimizing viewing for mobile, tablet, and desktop displays.  This was built using only HTML and CSS.
